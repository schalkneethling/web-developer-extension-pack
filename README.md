# vscode-extension-pack-skeleton

A starter skeleton for VSCode extension packs - https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/03/07/extension-pack-roundup

## Getting started

Ensure that you have [nvm installed](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) and run `nvm install stable && nvm use stable` to use the latest stable version of Node.js. Once installed, run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

## Automatic publishing

For the included [GitHub workflow](.github/workflows/publish-extension.yml) to run successfully you need a VSCode marketplace [personal access token](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#get-a-personal-access-token) configured as a [repository secret](https://github.com/project-calavera/vscode-extension-pack-skeleton/settings/secrets/actions) with the key: `VSCODE_MARKETPLACE_TOKEN`.
